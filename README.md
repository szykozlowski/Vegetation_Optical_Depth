# Overview

These are some files from the work I did during my Summer internship.  My work focused on doing analysis on data collected through the use of "Vegetation Optical Depth" (VOD).

VOD is a releively new technology, which functions based on microwaves emitted from a satellite.  Observing the frequency and strength of these microwaves can give important insight into many aspects of vegetation.  In my research, I was focusing on the relationship between VOD data, and the Volumetric Water Content (VWC) of soil.

## TDR vs VOD

In order to verify the validity of VOD data, I compared it to data collected through "Time Domain Reflectrometry" (TDR).  TDR is known to be very accurate, as it is data collected directly from the plants through the use of electric frequencies.
