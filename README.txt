This is a compilation of some of the files utilized in my internship during the summer of 2022.  

The primary goal was to visualize and project files containing VOD (Vegetation Optical Depth) and TDR (Time Domain Reflectrometry) data.

Then, the emprical differences between the two methods of collecting soil moisture data were compared to eachother to determine the validity of the reletively new VOD technology.
